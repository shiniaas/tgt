1. write invalidate support - done
2. multiple LUN support - done
3. Asymantic system (Nodes have different systems)
4. Cache refill when write IO request issues.
5. memcpy(src, dst). dst memory location improvement. - done
6. numa_run_on_node should be happened before numa_alloc_onnode, otherwise
numa_alloc_onnode would take no effect. bug this bug to community.
7. numa_run_on_node to default node. - done
8. free numa network buffer when the connection is freed
9. reduce large memory management overhead
10. tcp engine support NUMA-aware cache. - done
	need improvement for seperate mutex on each NUMA node.
11. split_io cache
	used for cache the result of split_io
	key (lun, lba, length) - value (numa node)
12. O_DIRECT needs page alignment... how to fix this problem? - done
	read - 
	write - read a cache block each time, update it, and write it back 
13. WRITE policy: updating cache block instead of invalidate cache block - done
14. take out NUMA-aware cache as an independent module for other software
